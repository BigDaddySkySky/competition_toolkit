# MWCCDC Ansible Automation (Competition Repository)

**Primary objective:** Secure reachable Linux services in the first ~20 minutes  
**Secondary objective:** Preserve scoring, access, and availability

This repository contains **competition-day automation only**.  
It is intentionally strict, minimal, and opinionated.

---

## Operator Assumptions (Read First)

This repository assumes:

- You are operating **after drop flag**
- You have valid credentials (SSH + sudo) for **at least one Linux host**
- You are running from a Linux control node (Ubuntu preferred)
- You are prioritizing service uptime and scoring stability over completeness

If any of the above are false, **do not proceed blindly**.

---

## Design Principles

1. **Connectivity First**  
   No host is modified until SSH connectivity is verified.

2. **Graceful Degradation**  
   If a host is unreachable, automation continues on others.

3. **Competition Safety**  
   No hostname changes, no IP changes, no service removals unless explicitly defined.

4. **Operator Clarity**  
   Playbooks are numbered and intended to be run in order.

5. **No Heroics**  
   Safe defaults are preferred over aggressive hardening.

## Competition-Day Quick Start

### 1) Bootstrap the control environment

Run once on the control node:

```bash
./scripts/bootstrap.sh
````

This prepares Python, Ansible, required collections, and validates vault access.

---

### 2) Establish and preserve access

```bash
ansible-playbook playbooks/00-bootstrap-keys.yml -k
```

This deploys your SSH public key to reachable hosts.
Do **not** proceed until you confirm key-based access works.

If Splunk requires a separate initial password:

```bash
ansible-playbook playbooks/00-bootstrap-keys.yml -l splunk -k
```

---

### 3) Rotate credentials (intentional, not blind)

```bash
ansible-playbook playbooks/01-rotate-passwords.yml
```

Only run once:

* SSH access is verified
* You can manually recover a host if needed

---

### 4) Run the critical path (first ~20 minutes)

```bash
ansible-playbook playbooks/02-critical-path.yml
```

Applies competition-tested baseline controls to reachable hosts.

---

### 5) Configure telemetry (after stabilization)

```bash
ansible-playbook playbooks/03-configure-splunk.yml
ansible-playbook playbooks/04-install-forwarders.yml
```

Centralized logging should be enabled **after** core services are stable.

---

### 6) Establish file integrity baselines (optional, time-permitting)

```bash
ansible-playbook playbooks/05-fim-baseline.yml
```

This creates initial AIDE baselines and may take several minutes per host.

## Secrets and Vault Handling

Sensitive values (passwords, service credentials, webhooks) are stored in **Ansible Vault**.

* Vault passwords are never committed
* Vault contents are encrypted and guarded with `no_log: true`
* Vault access is provided out-of-band via `~/.vault_pass`

See:

* `group_vars/VAULT_CONTENTS.md`
* `host_vars/VAULT_CONTENTS.md`

---

## What NOT to Do During Competition

Do **not**:

* Rename hosts or change IP addresses
* Run unnumbered or experimental playbooks
* Modify firewall rules unless explicitly defined
* Rotate passwords without validation
* Run automation on hosts you cannot recover manually

If unsure, **pause and reassess**.

---

## When to Stop

Stop automation immediately if:

* SSH access is lost to a critical host
* A scored service becomes unavailable
* White Team guidance conflicts with automation behavior

Manual intervention takes priority.

---

## Success Criteria

You are succeeding if:

* SSH access is preserved
* Services remain available
* Credentials are controlled
* Telemetry is flowing
* You can explain every change made

## Final Note

This repository exists to **buy time and reduce risk**, not to replace operator judgment.
