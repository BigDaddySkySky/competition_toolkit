# Competition Toolkit

This repository contains a consolidated set of tools, scripts, documentation, and templates
used by our collegiate Blue Team during CCDC-style cyber defense competitions.

The contents represent contributions from multiple team members and prior iterations of
our tooling, merged into a single, organized repository for competition use.

---

## Purpose

The goal of this toolkit is to support:
- Secure baseline configuration and hardening
- Service availability and validation
- Incident detection and response
- Documentation and inject handling
- Operational consistency under time pressure

All materials are intended to assist Blue Team operations without violating competition rules.

---

## Repository Structure

- **docs/**  
  Competition references, rules summaries, platform notes, and procedures.

- **automation/**  
  Configuration management and automation tooling (e.g., Ansible, hardening tasks, monitoring).

- **scripts/**  
  Standalone scripts for diagnostics, validation, and administration.  
  All scripts are readable and accompanied by documentation.

- **checklists/**  
  Quick-reference operational checklists for common competition phases.

- **templates/**  
  Reusable document templates for inject responses, incident reports, and change tracking.

- **archive/**  
  Legacy or experimental content retained for reference but not used directly.

---

## Usage Notes

- All tools are open-source or natively available in competition environments.
- No proprietary software, encrypted archives, or prebuilt virtual machines are included.
- Scripts are provided as reference implementations and may require adaptation.
- Templates are intentionally generic and do not contain pre-written inject responses.

## Compliance

This repository is intended to comply with Midwest and National CCDC repository guidelines.
Content is limited to defensive tooling, documentation, and operational references.

## Disclaimer

This toolkit is provided as-is for educational and competition use.
Teams are responsible for understanding the impact of any tool or configuration
on scoring, availability, and competition rules.
